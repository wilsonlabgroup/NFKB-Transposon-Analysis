## Multi-Species NFKB-Transposon Analysis

This repository contains supplementary scripts for a comparative genomics study of RELA (a key NF-ÎºB subunit) transcription factor binding and its association with transposable elements in human, mouse, and cow genomes.

See `NFKB_TE_study.Rmd` for detailed reproducible code.
